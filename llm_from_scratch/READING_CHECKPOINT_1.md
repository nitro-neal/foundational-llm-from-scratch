Complete Analysis of the LLM from Scratch Implementation
Overview
This code implements the foundational components of a GPT-style transformer model from scratch. It focuses on understanding how language models process text through tokenization, embeddings, and attention mechanisms.
Step-by-Step Analysis
1. Data Loading and Text Processing
Apply to self_attenti...
)
What it does: Loads a short story ("The Verdict") as training data
Sample content: "I HAD always thought Jack Gisburn rather a cheap genius--though a good fellow enough..."
Purpose: Provides text data for the model to learn from
2. Tokenization Setup
Apply to self_attenti...
)
How GPTDatasetV1 works:
Input: Raw text + tokenizer + max_length + stride
Process:
Tokenizes entire text into integer IDs
Creates sliding windows of max_length tokens
Each window becomes an input-target pair where target is input shifted by 1 position
Example with max_length=4:
If tokens are: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...]
Input chunk: [1, 2, 3, 4], Target chunk: [2, 3, 4, 5]
Next input: [5, 6, 7, 8], Target: [6, 7, 8, 9]
3. Configuration Setup

4. Embedding Layers Creation

)
Token Embedding: Maps each token ID to a 256-dimensional vector
Positional Embedding: Adds position information to each token
5. Data Loading and Embedding

:
Example Output:
x.shape: [8, 4] (batch_size=8, sequence_length=4)
token_embeddings.shape: [8, 4, 256]
pos_embeddings.shape: [4, 256]
input_embeddings.shape: [8, 4, 256]

values
Causal Masking:

)
Prevents the model from looking at future tokens
Essential for autoregressive generation
Example with 2 heads:
Input: [8, 4, 256]
Each head processes [8, 4, 128] (256/2 = 128 per head)
Output: [8, 4, 256] (heads are concatenated back)
Key Classes Analysis
SimpleTokenizerV1
Purpose: Basic tokenizer that splits text into tokens
Limitations: Not used in main.py (tiktoken is used instead)
Method: Regex-based splitting on punctuation and whitespace
DataProcessor
Purpose: Downloads data and creates vocabulary
Not used: Main code uses tiktoken directly
Would be useful: For custom datasets
GPTDatasetV1
Purpose: Creates training examples from text
Key feature: Sliding window approach with configurable stride
Output: Input-target pairs for next-token prediction
SelfAttentionV1 vs V2
V1: Uses nn.Parameter for weight matrices
V2: Uses nn.Linear layers (more standard)
Both: Implement basic self-attention mechanism
MultiHeadAttention
Most sophisticated: Implements the full multi-head attention
Features:
Multiple attention heads
Causal masking
Dropout
Output projection
Execution Flow Example
Let's trace through with actual values:
Text: "I HAD always thought"
Tokens: [40, 367, 1464, 1807, 2497] (example IDs)
With max_length=4:
Input: [40, 367, 1464, 1807]
Target: [367, 1464, 1807, 2497]
Embeddings: Each token becomes 256-dimensional vector
Attention: Model learns to focus on relevant previous tokens
